Best Practices for Qubic Smart Contracts
Smart Contract Initialization

Always initialize all state variables explicitly
Managing Smart Contract Balances

Fetch SC balance dynamically using qpi.getEntity()
Never assume a fixed amount—always track incoming and outgoing funds
Handling Transactions Correctly

Ensure transactions are properly validated before modifying state
Using State Variables Correctly

Store all necessary data in state—Qubic SCs do not retain local variables between calls
Security Best Practices

Use require() conditions before modifying state
Validate input values
Use proper balance fetching methods
